A shiny app to visualize gene expression in brain cell types. For detailed info about the annotations feel free to send a [mail](mailto:ogan.mancarci+cte@gmail.com). Hosted [here](http://neuroexpresso.org/).

## Data
Expression data that makes the app tick can be found [here](http://pavlab.msl.ubc.ca/supplement-to-mancarci-et-al-neuroexpresso/) along with all other data used in the [Mancarci et al. 2017](http://www.eneuro.org/content/4/6/ENEURO.0212-17.2017) paper.
