# cellTypeExpression
A shiny app to visualize gene expression in brain cell types. This is a preliminary version primarily intended for internal use. For detailed info about the annotations feel free to send a [mail](mailto:ogan.mancarci+cte@gmail.com). Hosted [here](https://oganm.github.io/celltypes).

## Data
Expression data that makes the app tick is not available at the moment since someone in the lab noticed we are not really allowed 
it includes data acquired through personal communications. We are working to make the whole dataset or a sharable subset of it available.
