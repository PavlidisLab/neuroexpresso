# cellTypeExpression
A shiny app to visualize gene expression in brain cell types. This is a preliminary version primarily intended for internal use. For detailed info about the annotations feel free to send a [mail](mailto:ogan.mancarci+cte@gmail.com). Hosted [here](https://oganm.github.io/neuroexpresso).

## Data
Expression data that makes the app tick can be found in the [neuroExpressoAnalysis](https://github.com/oganm/neuroExpressoAnalysis) package along with all other data used in the Macnarci et al. 2017 (submitted) paper. Raw data files can be found [here](https://github.com/oganm/neuroExpressoAnalysis/tree/master/data-raw/Mouse_Cell_Type_Data).
